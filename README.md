# Instagram-Reach-and-Prediction

This project involves analyzing Instagram data to uncover insights and trends. Using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, we visualize data distributions and relationships between key metrics like impressions, likes, comments, shares, and saves. Word clouds are generated to analyze frequently used captions and hashtags. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of factors driving engagement on Instagram, aiding in data-driven decision-making for social media strategies.
